# About

The genomics tutorials were developed with funding from the 
The Food and Health Flagship, an [RDS-funded](http://omics.data.edu.au/)
project to provide cloud-based data services and tools
for Australian Life Science Researchers to combine, analyse and interpret
genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data.  The data platform
will incorporate the 
[Bioplatforms Australia Antibiotic Resistant Pathogens Initiative (ABRPI)](http://www.bioplatforms.com/antibiotic-resistant-pathogens/).
