The type species for this genus is yellow fever virus, and the genus includes dengue virus, west nile virus and zika virus.  Viruses from this genus have a single-segment genome of about 11 kb. Within this, there is a 10 kb open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein. Following translation, this protein is modified to yield the various, mature structural and non-structural viral proteins as illustrated in Fig. 1.   Fig. 1 - An overview of a typical flavivirus genome and the viral proteins that are part of the viral polyprotein (from  Viralzone ).  There are 14 complete Murray Valley encephalitis virus genome sequences available at NCBI Viral Genomes.   Go to NCBI  Viral Genomes .  Select  Browse viral genomes by family  and click on the family  Flaviviridae :  Complete Genomes  Note: you may have to widen your screen to see all the columns of viral family names.     Look at the row for Murray Valley encephelitis virus. In the Neigbours column, we can see there are 14.    In this tutorial we will use the prototype strain 1-151 as the reference genome sequence.   This strain was isolated in the early 1950s - see  AF161266 .    The isolate we are looking at has been sequenced using the Illumina platform.   The genomic cDNA was prepared using random hexamers to prime the reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA.  After second strand synthesis, the cDNA was used to prepare an Illumina sequencing library and run on an Illumina MiSeq instrument.   In this activity we will use a read mapping approach to determine the sequence of a new Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate.",

Approximately 95% of reads were classified as  Staphylococcus aureus , confirming the correct identity of our bacterial sample.   Of these reads, roughly half were uniquely present in  S. aureus  subsp.  aureus , and most of those were uniquely present in strain HO 5096 0412.  The sample strain is therefore most related to the HO 5096 0412 strain.   The remaining reads within the  S. aureus  clade were classified into various taxa.
